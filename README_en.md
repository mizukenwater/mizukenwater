# Job description
## Self Introduction
Kenji Mizuguchi was born in 1998.  
After graduating from high school, I moved to Tokyo to work as a web engineer. I have worked for several startup ventures as a full-time employee and outsourcer.  
I mainly works on Ruby (Ruby On Rails) for backend development and JavaScript (React.js/TypeScript) for frontend development.  
Recently, I have been catching up with NestJS and Next.js, and prefer to use those technology stacks in my personal development.

## Self-PR
### Management skills to keep projects moving forward steadily.
I have had the opportunity to manage several times at the sites I have been involved in.
I was often entrusted with projects that required relatively close communication with various departments, so I regularly checked in with each department and worked closely with them.
As a result, we were able to complete the project with minimal rework, no extension of deadlines, and no project flare-ups.

### Communication skills that offend no one
It may seem strange to write this here, but I am not a big fan of people with strong language. This is because it greatly reduces the productivity of the team. I have encountered such situations on several occasions in the workplaces I have had the privilege of working with. Therefore, I try not to use strong language so as not to lower the morale of the team.
I am often told by my co-workers, "Mizuguchi-kun, you are so kind, aren't you?

### Quick catch-up
As an engineer, you have to keep up with the latest technological trends. As I followed them, I realized that my ability to catch up was superior to others. As a testament to this, when I entered a site with no GraphQL experience, it did not take much time to catch up on GraphQL.
Entering a site with inexperienced technology is a bit of pressure, but I think this catch-up ability allows me to be proactive in taking on challenges.
